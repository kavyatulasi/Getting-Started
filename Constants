PL/SQL Constants
A constant is a value used in a PL/SQL block that remains unchanged throughout the program.
It is a user-defined literal value. It can be declared and used instead of actual values.

Let's take an example to explain it well:

Suppose, you have to write a program which will increase the salary of the employees upto 30%,
you can declare a constant and use it throughout the program. Next time if you want to increase the salary again
you can change the value of constant than the actual value throughout the program.

Syntax:
constant_name CONSTANT datatype := VALUE;  

Constant_name:it is the name of constant just like variable name. The constant word is a reserved word and its 
value does not change.

VALUE: it is a value which is assigned to a constant when it is declared. It can not be assigned later.
